== How to install plug-in? ==

When you want to install a plug-in, just download it and extract files to plugins directory: 
{{{
  app/
     plugins/
       plugin1/
       plugin2/
       YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME/
       ...
}}}

Then, we need to enable the plugin in app/configs/rplugin.php:
{{{
$plugins["YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME"]["enabled"] = 1;
...
}}}

Replace "YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME" to what the plug-in named, and save the file to the disk.

Now, everything will goes well.
