== How to disable authentication? ==

From v1.0.10, there is two ways to disable authentication.

First way, set server option "auth_enabled" to false in config.php:

{{{
         array(
		"host" => "192.168.1.1",
		"port" => "27017",
		"username" => null,
		"password" => null,
		"auth_enabled" => false,
		"admins" => array( 
			"admin" => "admin"
		)
	)
}}}

Second way, remove or comment all of admins:
{{{
         array(
		"host" => "192.168.1.1",
		"port" => "27017",
		"username" => null,
		"password" => null,
		"auth_enabled" => true,
		"admins" => array( 
			//"admin" => "admin"
		)
	)
}}}

== PHP Error: Fatal error: Allowed memory size when export a large DB == 

To export a large db, you need to change your configures in your php.ini :

{{{
max_execution_time = 30
memory_limit = 128M
}}}

to larger numbers, such as:

{{{
max_execution_time = 1200
memory_limit = 1024M
}}}

Then you need to restart your web server (apache, nginx ....).
